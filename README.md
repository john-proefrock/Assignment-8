# Assignment-8
In this assignment, I created a presentation that describes some of my personal 
and academic background, as well as some of the things I learned in FISH 549.

I included a slide that lists three things I enjoyed learning about in the course,
as well as three things I'd like to learn more about.

I concluded the presentation with a picture of a surf smelt that I edited in
Illustrator to include a thank you message.
